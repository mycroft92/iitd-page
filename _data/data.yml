        title: Secure Composition in Synchronous Dataflow systems
        link: "#"
        tagline: 'Synchronous reactive data flow is a paradigm that provides a high-level abstract programming model for embedded and cyber-physical systems, including the locally synchronous components of IoT systems. 
Security in such systems is severely compromised due to low-level programming, ill-defined interfaces and inattention to security classification of data.   
By incorporating a Denning-style lattice-based secure information flow framework into a synchronous reactive data flow language, we provide a framework in which correct-and-secure-by-construction implementations for such systems can be specified and derived.  
In particular, we extend the <a href="https://velus.inria.fr">Lustre</a>  programming framework with a security type system. The work is currently being formalized in Coq over VÃ¨lus development.'
